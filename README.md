VRPE++
======
VRPE++ is a lightweight port of [VibRibbonPakExtractor](https://github.com/resistiv/VibRibbonPakExtractor) to C++, created to familiarize myself with the language in preparation for my CS 101 course.
All functionality from the original VibRibbonPakExtractor remains exactly the same, and proper documentation can be found within its repository.
